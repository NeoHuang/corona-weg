# What is this

this project is to visualize current number of confirmed infections and deaths
in Germany as well as providing a raw data API

# How does it work

this project consist of a server which scrape [Robert Koch Institute](https://www.rki.de/DE/Content/InfAZ/N/Neuartiges_Coronavirus/Fallzahlen.html) every 9 minute and export the data for Promethues. The scraped data can also be accessed via `/api/epidemic`. 

Prometheus service will scrape the exported data and Grafana is used to visualize the result

# Run the server

the server can be run via a single command (you need to have docker installed)

```sh
docker-compose up
```

the docker-compose will run the server as container and expose port `8404`. Also it will spin up
Prometheus(port 9090) and Grafana(port 3000). 

if you see some permission error from prometheus or grafana service, make sure `/data` folder is writable by the user.

# Hosted service
